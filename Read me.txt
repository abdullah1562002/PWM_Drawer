Project Details:
Project Author: Abdullah Abdelgalel
Group: D54
Overview:
Welcome to the PWM_Drawer project repository, the culmination of Abdullah Abdelgalel's Final Graduation Project. This repository encompasses various components aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of the project.

Contents:
Simulation files:

A visual representation showcasing the functionality of the PWM_Drawer project and protoues design files.
Flow Chart:

A detailed flow chart illustrating the structure and logic of the PWM_Drawer application.
Calculations File:

Comprehensive calculations file providing insights into the mathematical aspects of the project.
Project Files:

PWM_Drawer (Non-layered Architecture Format):

All module files organized in a non-layered architecture format. Simplifies understanding and modification of individual components.
PWM_Drawer_Layered (Layered Architecture Format):

All program files organized in a layered architecture format, including MCAL, HAL, APP, and UTILITIES. Enhances modularity and scalability.
Recommendations:
It is advisable to initially run the PWM_Drawer project. Some IDEs may encounter issues with the layered architecture in PWM_Drawer_Layered due to includes in different file locations.
Getting Started:
Open the project in your Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
If issues arise, consider running the non-layered version (PWM_Drawer).
Refer to the provided video simulation, flow chart, and calculations file for a comprehensive understanding of the project.
Feel free to explore, modify, and adapt the project according to your needs.
